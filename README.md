# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

In this case we are given data about ride-sharing across the spectrum of city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  We are to assess the differences and provide feedback on what can be done business wise.

## Results

The first major difference we see is in the huge gap across all things looked at between Urban and Rural with the Suburban areas falling in the middle.  Urban areas amount of total drivers, rides, and total fares all far exceed Rural areas while the inverse is true of average fare per driver and ride with Rural areas outpacing Urban areas.

It must also be noted though that when we look at the line graph while there are significant differences in volume all three city types remain consistent in most spikes and lows.  It would be beneficial to provide a clearer picture of proposals to find if these ratios to population are consistent as well.

## Summary

My first recommendation is to expand the data to include average populations within the city types.  This will allow for more perspective and what you can do to mitigate disparities.  Next, I would look at expanding outreach to the Rural areas.  Based on the data, rural rides tend to be longer yielding more profit; and relative to the volume of Urban and even Suburban areas, the Rural areas has far less drivers.  If the problem is not enough drivers then marketing geared toward recruitment would be the best fit, but if the problem is too few customers outreach towards consumers would be better.
